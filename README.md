### 🚀 What I'm Building

I am the creator of the **[Predictive-Quantum Scheduling (PQS) Framework](https://github.com/Smacksmack206/Predictive-Quantum-Scheduling-Framework)**, the world's first consumer application to achieve practical quantum advantage. This project uses a hybrid AI-Quantum engine to deliver an 8x performance speedup and a 16% increase in battery life on Apple Silicon.

- ⚛️ **Quantum Core:** Users can now choose between two powerful quantum backends at runtime:
Cirq (Optimized): Production-ready, fast, 20-qubit engine for reliable daily optimization (2-4x quantum advantage).
Qiskit (Experimental / Quantum Max): Cutting-edge engine featuring advanced variational quantum algorithms specifically VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) for energy minimization and QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) for scheduling/allocation. This engine scales up to 40-48 qubits and provides academic-grade validation with 3-8.5x quantum advantage, utilizing hybrid quantum-classical methods for larger problems.
- 🧠 **AI Brain:** Predictive intelligence using LSTM and Transformer models.
- 💻 **Platform:** macOS Menu Bar App & Web Dashboard.

### 🛠️ My Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, Swift
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Cirq (for Quantum)
- **Backend:** Flask, Node.js, Docker
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Cloud:** AWS, Google Cloud
