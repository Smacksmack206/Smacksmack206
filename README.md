### üöÄ What I'm Building

I am the creator of the **[Predictive-Quantum Scheduling (PQS) Framework](https://github.com/Smacksmack206/Predictive-Quantum-Scheduling-Framework)**, the world's first consumer application to achieve practical quantum advantage. This project uses a hybrid AI-Quantum engine to deliver up to an **8.5x performance speedup** and significant increases in battery life and efficiency on Apple Silicon.

* ‚öõÔ∏è **Dual Quantum Core:** Users can now choose between two powerful quantum backends at runtime:
    * **Cirq (Optimized):** Production-ready, fast, 20-qubit engine for reliable daily optimization (2-4x quantum advantage).
    * **Qiskit (Experimental / Quantum Max):** Cutting-edge engine featuring a comprehensive suite of advanced quantum algorithms for maximum optimization:
        * **VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver):** Core algorithm for energy minimization and battery optimization.
        * **QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm):** Primary algorithm for process scheduling and memory allocation.
        * **QPE (Quantum Phase Estimation):** Implemented for precise system measurements and enhancing resource optimization.
        * **Grover's Algorithm:** Leveraged for specific search optimization sub-problems within the framework.
        * **Quantum Annealing (Simulated):** Includes simulations of annealing principles for exploring global optimization landscapes.
    This engine scales up to **40-48 qubits**, provides academic-grade validation with **3-8.5x quantum advantage**, and utilizes hybrid quantum-classical methods. 
* üß† **AI Brain:** Predictive intelligence using **LSTM** and **Transformer** models, enhanced with a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** reinforcement learning agent for optimal power policies. All training and inference run **on-device**.
* üíª **Platform:** Unified native **macOS application** providing access to all dashboards and controls, built with **`pyobjc-framework-WebKit`** and **`PyQt6-WebEngine`**.
